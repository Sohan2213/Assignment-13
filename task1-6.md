Create 4 Notebooks for Reading and Writing to Delta Tables
Notebook 1:
Read from the source table.
Insert or update data into Delta Table 1.
Notebook 2:
Read from the source table.
Insert or update data into Delta Table 2.
Notebook 3:
Read from the source table.
Insert or update data into Delta Table 3.
Notebook 4:
Read from the source table.
Insert or update data into Delta Table 4.
Ensure that each notebook uses proper error handling and logging mechanisms.
2. Create an Orchestration Notebook using dbutils
In this notebook, youâ€™ll sequentially run the four notebooks using dbutils.notebook.run().
python
Copy code
dbutils.notebook.run("Notebook1", 0)
dbutils.notebook.run("Notebook2", 0)
dbutils.notebook.run("Notebook3", 0)
dbutils.notebook.run("Notebook4", 0)
This approach ensures that the notebooks are executed one after the other.

3. Create a Parallel Orchestration Notebook (Concurrent Execution)
Use concurrent.futures to run the notebooks in parallel.
python
Copy code
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

notebooks = ["Notebook1", "Notebook2", "Notebook3", "Notebook4"]

def run_notebook(nb):
    dbutils.notebook.run(nb, 0)

with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = executor.map(run_notebook, notebooks)
This will execute the notebooks in parallel, reducing overall runtime.

4. Create Jobs for Both Notebooks using Databricks Jobs API
Using the Jobs API, you can automate the creation of the orchestration jobs. For each notebook, create a job by making a POST request to the Databricks Jobs API with the configuration of the notebooks.

Example configuration (in JSON):

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Sequential_Job",
  "new_cluster": {
    "spark_version": "10.x.x-scala2.x",
    "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2",
    "num_workers": 2
  },
  "notebook_task": {
    "notebook_path": "/Users/YourName/Sequential_Notebook"
  }
}
Similarly, create another job for the parallel notebook.
5. Schedule Jobs using the Jobs API and Create Clusters with the Cluster API
Schedule the jobs using Jobs API, specifying the trigger type (daily, weekly, etc.).

Create clusters with the Clusters API for both the sequential and parallel jobs. For consistency, create similar clusters with the same configurations.

json
Copy code
{
  "num_workers": 2,
  "cluster_name": "Parallel_Job_Cluster",
  "spark_version": "10.x.x-scala2.x",
  "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2",
  "autotermination_minutes": 30
}
6. Compare Runtime of Sequential and Parallel Jobs
Once the jobs are created and scheduled, compare the runtime between the Sequential Job and the Parallel Job.
In the Databricks Jobs UI, you can view the execution time and logs for both jobs. Check the total time taken for the sequential versus parallel execution to analyze performance improvements.
